Do not use this code for anything real - it was an interesting contrarian diversion only.

It makes a call to OpenAI GPT-4 to generate a video challenge for either the current month if the day is <15 or the next month.
It then draws a console based render of the calendar.

It depends on curl and remind commands being installed and the json_module module being available.

It was written on a Mac, but anything with gfortran and the above commands should work.
